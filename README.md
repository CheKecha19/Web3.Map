# ❓ EWOO labs FAQ

## Status and progress

EWOO labs started as a web2 company in [fall 2022](https://twitter.com/EWOO\_labs/status/1580482411871076352) on a mission to map all web3 knowledge in one place.&#x20;

**Map development:** We are developing a web2 version at this moment. After development of web2 version we will work for full web3 integration of our database.

**Whitepaper:** We have written our whitepaper, which is currently in review to be made public soon.

**Hiring:** We are hiring fast and have many open roles. Feel free to apply or share. For applying you should be in our discord server.

### When will a token be released?

There is currently no **EWOO** token and no set date for release. The team will clearly communicate this release well in advance of the launch.

{% hint style="info" %}
Important: We will \*never\* directly message you about the token sale, so please do not interact with any such messages as they are spam. When we launch the token, we will do so on multiple marketing channels including core discord announcements channels, twitter and our blog.

The team is working aggressively towards a testnet launch. Currently we are creating our web2 version. We will announce web3 version and $EWOO token after compliting web2 version.&#x20;

Up to 1% of the token treasury will be awarded to the community for correct data submission and validation.

### How can I perform validation tasks?

The Triple Validation Guide covers mechanics and common questions around validation.

### **When are other languages going to be supported?**

We want to prove the unit economics and security of the system first in English (the language of our original team). If it works we want to open up to multiple languages (as it should be!). Please don’t make non-English edits at this point as we don’t support it yet.

### **I want to be a mod in discord, how should I approach EWOO labs?**

We are still configuring discord for more mass scale so DMing team members will only slow the protocol development down. However, long term, we are interested in mods and have a backlog to verify and setup systems around it. If you have experience in this area please add to your introductions in the introductions channel and we will see it. We are booting up moderators in a careful way to prevent security issues.
