# ❓ EWOO labs FAQ

## Status and progress

EWOO labs started as a web2 company in [fall 2022](https://twitter.com/EWOO\_labs/status/1580482411871076352) on a mission to map all web3 knowledge in one place.&#x20;

**Map development:** We are developing a web2 version at this moment. After development of web2 version we will work for full web3 integration of our database.

**Whitepaper:** We have written our whitepaper, which is currently in review to be made public soon.

**Hiring:** We are hiring fast and have many open roles. Feel free to apply or share. For applying you should be in our discord server.

### **What’s the TLDR on how the protocol works?**

### When will a token be released?

There is currently no **EWOO** token and no set date for release. The team will clearly communicate this release well in advance of the launch.

{% hint style="info" %}
Important: We will \*never\* directly message you about the token sale, so please do not interact with any such messages as they are spam. When we launch the token, we will do so on multiple marketing channels including core discord announcements channels, twitter and our blog.

The team is working aggressively towards a testnet launch. Currently we are creating our web2 version. We will announce web3 version and $EWOO token after compliting web2 version.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **How will airdrops be awarded**

At this time, performing the following tasks will make you eligible for an airdrop:

* submitting pages that go on to be accepted
* performing correct validation
* adding a citation to a pages that exists on EWOO labs that doesn’t have a citation already

Up to 1% of the token treasury will be awarded to the community for correct data submission and validation.

### How can I perform validation tasks?

The Triple Validation Guide covers mechanics and common questions around validation.

### I have been adding pages, are my efforts being counted?

Yes! You will eligible for an airdrop reward relative to the number of correct pages you have submitted when we launch our token on the mainnet.

**Note**: for additions to be counted towards airdrop rewards they must follow the Adding Structured Data Guide and not attempt to game our validation protocol.

### I have been adding citations, are my efforts being counted?

Yes! Adding valid citations to any pages that is missing a citation will qualify you for a special airdrop, and will help the pages you have cited become validated. Citations should be focused around pages that are not URL predicates, especially pages added after the launch of ewoolabs.xyz.

### How can I find my position in the leaderboard?

Leaderboard not aviable at not. Dont worry, all submissions will be counted.

### **Do I need to paste the edit I have done into discord?**

No, we have full logs of all edits being made on ewoolabs.xyz

### **When are other languages going to be supported?**

We want to prove the unit economics and security of the system first in English (the language of our original team). If it works we want to open up to multiple languages (as it should be!). Please don’t make non-English edits at this point as we don’t support it yet.

### **I want to be a mod in discord, how should I approach EWOO labs?**

We are still configuring discord for more mass scale so DMing team members will only slow the protocol development down. However, long term, we are interested in mods and have a backlog to verify and setup systems around it. If you have experience in this area please add to your introductions in the introductions channel and we will see it. We are booting up moderators in a careful way to prevent security issues.
